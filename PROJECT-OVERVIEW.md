## 🚀 Quick Evaluation (5 Minutes)

Want to see if this is right for your team? Follow this 5-minute evaluation:

### Step 1: Install and Demo (2 minutes)
```bash
git clone <this-repo> ai-builder-test
cd ai-builder-test
npm install
npm run ai:demo
```

### Step 2: Check Output (1 minute)
```bash
# Look at the generated Angular component
cat src/pages/claimsdashboard.component.ts

# Run quality validation
npm run ai:quality examples/angular-claims-dashboard.spec.json
```

### Step 3: Try Your Own (2 minutes)
```bash
# Create a simple prompt
echo "Create a user login form with email, password, and remember me checkbox" > prompts/login.md

# Generate (if you have an API key)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx npm run ai:build -- --prompt prompts/login.md

# Or try modifying the existing specification
npm run ai:build -- --from-spec examples/angular-claims-dashboard.spec.json --out test-components
```

### ✅ **Evaluation Checklist**
After 5 minutes, you should see:
- [ ] Clean, production-ready Angular component generated
- [ ] Proper TypeScript interfaces and imports
